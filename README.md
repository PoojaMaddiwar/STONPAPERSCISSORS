Rock-paper-scissors:<br>
is a simple hand game usually played between two people. <br>
Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand:<br><br>

Rock (a fist): Rock crushes scissors.<br>
Paper (an open hand): Paper covers rock.<br>
Scissors (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V): Scissors cut paper.<br><br>

The game has three possible outcomes, other than a tie:<br>

Rock crushes scissors (Rock wins)<br>
Scissors cut paper (Scissors wins)<br>
Paper covers rock (Paper wins)<br><br><br>
If both players choose the same shape, the game is a tie, and typically, it's played again to break the tie. The simplicity and unpredictability of the game make it a popular and quick decision-making activity. It's often used as a simple and fair way to resolve disputes or make decisions on the spot.
